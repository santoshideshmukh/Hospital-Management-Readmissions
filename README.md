# 🚑 Hospital ER Dashboard 🏥
Welcome to the Hospital Emergency Room (ER) Dashboard!
This data visualization tool provides a comprehensive overview of ER operations, helping hospital management track critical metrics such as patient wait times, bed availability, patient demographics, and staff performance.
By enabling data-driven decision-making, the dashboard empowers healthcare teams to improve ER efficiency, reduce readmissions, and enhance patient care. 🚑

**📌 Project Overview**


The Hospital-Management-Readmissions Dashboard is designed to support hospital administrators and clinicians in monitoring real-time operational data. By leveraging interactive charts and analytics, the system allows hospitals to identify bottlenecks, optimize patient flow, and minimize readmission rates.

This tool is especially useful for:

Monitoring emergency room activity.

Tracking resource utilization (beds, staff, equipment).

Analyzing readmission patterns for better healthcare planning.

**🎯 Features**


📊 Interactive Dashboard with real-time data visualization.

🕒 Patient Flow Tracking – monitor wait times and discharge efficiency.

🛏️ Bed Availability Management for better resource allocation.

👨‍⚕️ Staff Performance Insights to ensure quality care delivery.

📈 Readmission Analysis to reduce preventable hospital returns.

📂 Export & Reporting – generate insights for hospital decision-makers.

**🔧 Technologies Used**

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with charting libraries like Chart.js / D3.js)

Backend: Python (Flask/Django) or Node.js (if applicable)

Database: MySQL / PostgreSQL / MongoDB

Visualization Tools: Power BI / Tableau / IBM Cognos / Dash (depending on setup)

Deployment: Docker / XAMPP / Cloud Hosting (GCP, AWS, or Azure)
